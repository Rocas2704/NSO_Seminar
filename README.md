# IS-CLUST: Nonsmooth Clustering with LMBM and HSM

This repository implements the incremental clustering algorithm **IS-CLUST**, combining the *Minimum Sum-of-Distances Clustering* approach with two different nonsmooth optimization methods:

- **LMBM** (Limited Memory Bundle Method)
- **HSM** (Hyperbolic Smoothing Method)

The code is modular and structured for experimentation and performance comparisons between these solvers.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `MSIncClustSolver.py`  
  Contains the core implementation of the **MSInc-CLUST** algorithm. For each cluster increment:
  - Generates good candidate points (A‚ÇÖ) via an auxiliary optimization problem.
  - Selects the best candidate via the full clustering objective.
  - Supports both LMBM and HSM as underlying optimization strategies.

- `LMBMSolver.py`  
  Custom implementation of the Limited Memory Bundle Method, capable of solving nonsmooth, nonconvex problems using:
  - Serious/null step control
  - Subgradient aggregation
  - Limited-memory quasi-Newton updates (L-BFGS and SR1)

- `objective.py`  
  - `ClusteringObjective`: Full nonsmooth clustering loss + subgradient  
  - `AuxiliaryObjective`: Simplified (auxiliary) clustering objective used to filter candidate centers

- `HSMSolver.py`  
  - `SmoothedClusterObjective`: Smooth version of the full clustering problem (used in HSM)  
  - `SmoothedAuxiliaryObjective`: Smooth version of the auxiliary problem  
  - `SmoothingSolver`: œÑ-scheduling wrapper using L-BFGS-B

## üß™ How It Works

### Step-by-step Process

1. **Initialization**: The first center is the centroid of all data points.
2. **Incremental Loop (for `k` clusters)**:
   - Generate candidate points from `A‚ÇÄ` using local distances.
   - Filter and refine candidates through an auxiliary optimization (solved with LMBM or HSM).
   - Evaluate the full clustering objective for all `A‚ÇÖ` candidates.
   - Choose the best-performing center and append it.
3. **(Optional)**: Run a final refinement with the full clustering objective over all centers.
